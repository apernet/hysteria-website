# 3rd-party apps

We welcome and actively work with third-party proxy app developers to integrate Hysteria support into their projects. Below is a list of projects that support the Hysteria 2 protocol:

> Please note that Hysteria 2 is quite new. While there are many projects that support Hysteria, many of them refer to the older 1.x version. The protocols between Hysteria 1.x and Hysteria 2 are incompatible, so make sure you are using a client that is specifically compatible with Hysteria 2 when connecting to a Hysteria 2 server.

The following list is in alphabetical order. It does not indicate preference or ranking.
