# Performance

The following factors are common contributors to bottlenecks in your transfer speed:

- The quality of the connection between your device and the server
- The processing power of your CPU, NIC, etc.
- System buffer sizes
- Flow control receive window sizes
- Process priority

> It's worth noting that QUIC, being a much newer and more complex protocol running in userspace, will inherently require more processing power than the mature, highly optimized kernel-level implementation of TCP. If you want to achieve high transfer speeds, you should not host your server on low-power hardware such as a Raspberry Pi or an extremely low-cost, CPU-throttled VPS.

While the first two are beyond the scope of this documentation, the last three can be optimized to improve performance.

## System buffer sizes

### Linux

```bash
# Set both buffers to 16 MB
sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16777216
sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=16777216
```

### BSD/macOS

```bash
sysctl -w kern.ipc.maxsockbuf=20971520
sysctl -w net.inet.udp.recvspace=16777216
# UDP send buffer doesn't exist on BSD, so there's no "sendspace" to set
```

## Flow control receive window sizes

Hysteria has the following QUIC flow control receive window parameters in both client and server configurations:

```yaml
quic:
  initStreamReceiveWindow: 26843545 # (1)!
  maxStreamReceiveWindow: 26843545 # (2)!
  initConnReceiveWindow: 67108864 # (3)!
  maxConnReceiveWindow: 67108864 # (4)!
```

1. The initial receive window size for each stream. This is the amount of data that can be received before the sender has to wait for the receiver to consume it first. The default is 8 MB.
2. There is an auto-tuning mechanism for the receive window size that will increase the window size as needed, but will not exceed this value. The default is 8 MB.
3. The initial receive window size for the connection. This is the total receive window size for all streams. The default is 20 MB.
4. There is an auto-tuning mechanism for the receive window size that will increase the window size as needed, but will not exceed this value. The default is 20 MB.

You can increase these values if they are too low for your use case, or decrease them if you need to save memory. **We strongly recommend that you maintain a stream-to-connection receive window ratio close to 2/5.** This prevents one or two blocked streams from hogging the entire connection.

## Process priority

On devices with limited CPU resources, high load can cause latency jitter. This can be mitigated by increasing the process priority.

### systemd

For Linux.

Create `/etc/systemd/system/hysteria-server.service.d/priority.conf` and add the following:

```ini
[Service]
CPUSchedulingPolicy=fifo
CPUSchedulingPriority=99
CPUShares=2048
IOSchedulingClass=realtime
IOSchedulingPriority=0
IOWeight=1000
MemorySwapMax=0
OOMPolicy=continue
OOMScoreAdjust=-1000
```

Reload the systemd config files and restart the service using the following commands:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart hysteria-server.service
```

### chrt

For both Linux and FreeBSD. On FreeBSD, you need to install `util-linux`, and the highest priority is 31 instead of 99.

```bash
# Execute after each service start
chrt -r 99 $(pidof hysteria)

# Or, use the following command to start the service
chrt -r 99 hysteria server -c /path/to/config.yaml
```
